    <h1>Practicing the guitar</h1>
    <h3>Notes from a 10+ year professional guitar teacher</h3>
    <p>When practicing the guitar, think about what you'd like to learn and why. 
        Take some time to reflect and write down your goals.
    </p>
        
    <p>Balance playing and practicing: they are slightly different domains (that can sometimes overlap).</p>
